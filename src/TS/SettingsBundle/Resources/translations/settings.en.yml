api.tab.subtitle: Get access to your tournament from external systems
api.apiKeys.add: Create new API key
api.explanation: |
  If you are a (web) developer, you can use the API of Tournia to access your tournament information from other systems. For example, you can create your own (tv) screen layout with upcoming matches or let people fill in their scores.
  Check out the %startLink1%API documentation</a> and our %startLink2%GitHub repository</a> for examples.
  Use the secret value in the header as <code>X-API-KEY: secret</code>. <b>Keep your secret safe!</b> Other people can use it to change everything in your tournament. If you use the API key for example for displaying upcoming matches, use the read only access, which for security reasons only gives you access to GET request.
  The secret is generated after saving, and it's not possible to change the value.
