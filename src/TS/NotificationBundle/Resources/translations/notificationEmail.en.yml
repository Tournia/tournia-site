  Hi %tournamentContactName%,

  You created a new tournament on Tournia.net, welcome! Tournia is an online platform to help tournament organizers with everything they need to organize an awesome tournament.

  You have your own tournament website, which is located at %urlTournamentWebsite% You can promote this tournament website to potential participants.

  You can change the address of "%tournamentUrl%" in the settings section. Under settings you can also add additional pages for your tournament website, upload files or pictures, and adjust many more options. You can find the settings at: %urlTournamentSettings%

  It is advised that you configure your tournament in the best way, before you open your registrations. You need to setup the disciplines you're playing (for example Men Doubles B), and whether you want players to pay for their registration. It is also possible to add additional fields in the registration form, for example for a phone number or eating preferences.

  When you start playing matches, you use the tournament control module, or in short: control. Your tournament control is located at %urlTournamentControl%. On the Teams page you import the registrations, after which you can Auto Assign Players. A Team is in Tournia considered as one player for singles, or the two players for doubles. After you've formed the teams, you can start creating the matches. In the Plan matches screen, just click the Create new round button. Now you've created matches, you can put them on a court in the Current matches screen.

  On the top of the page you can search for players (press the search icon), see notifications, maximize the screen, etc. In the right top there is a green button, which you can use to navigate through all the modules in Tournia (very useful!).

  Thanks for trying out Tournia, and we hope you have an awesome tournament! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to send an email to info@tournia.net

  Kind regards,
  Tournia.net
